  everything will refresh whole app, components, Redux Store. except our Cookies.
  so, components are destroyed, re-creates newly, renders.


 Login Process :-
  i) email, password are sent to server.
     server validates credentials and sends "JWT Token"(with set-cookie headers) as response.
  ii) browser automatically saves "JWT Token" in "Cookies".
      note: cookies are not deleted. until we manually delete or time expired.

 User Login on Page Reload process(JWT in Cookies):-
   -> when we reload our page after login. i.e,'JWT' token already saved in Cookies during login.
   -> Browser reloads the page, all react components are destroyed, Redux Store is reset(fresh state).
      everything re-created from scratch.
   -> on App Startup:
      i) we make Authentication API call to get User Profile data.
         Browser automatically attaches our "JWT token" from cookies to the HTTP request.
      ii)Server validates our JWT token,  returns User Profile Data.
      iii)Client updates the Redux store with User data.

*****
Vercel Deployment Problem(page reload) :-
 you refreshed a client-side route -> vercel looked for a physical file in dist folder -> file didn't exist -> returned 404 error.
 Reloaded Page gives Error '404 NOT FOUND' after Vercel deployment platform.
 1) when you open deployed website normally:
    Vercel serves 'index.html'. React loads and React-Router handles routes like '/feed', '/profile'.
    everything works fine.
 2) when reload the website URL:
    *** Vercel thinks 'user is requesting a file' called '/feed' or '/profile' in 'dist folder'.
    since there is no physical file named 'feed or profile' in dist.
    vercel says '404: Not_Found'.
 Note:
    vite dev server automatically handle this. when run Locally(Local Host). on page reload, vite serves index.html for any route. React-Router handles the route on client-side.
    vercel don't do that automatically. vercel is 'static file server', which servers real files unless told using 'vercel.json' config file.

 Fix:
  create a 'vercel.json' config file in root directory. it tells Vercel to always serve index.html for any Route.
  vercel.json :-
    { "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }]}


 Definitions :-
 Single Page Application : there is one HTML file(index.html). all Routing is handled client-side using libraries like 'React-Router'.
